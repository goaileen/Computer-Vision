# Computer-Vision
Build an image resizing program using a seam-carving algorithm.

The learning goals of this project include Testing, Debugging, Pointers, Arrays, Strings, Streams, IO, and Abstract Data Types in C. Gains practice with C-style pointers, arrays, and structs.

The program uses seam carving for content-aware resizing of images. The algorithm works by finding and removing “seams” in the image that pass through the least important pixels.
